HTML Structure (cal.html):
The HTML file (cal.html) starts with the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration, indicating the document type and version.
Inside the <head> section, I include metadata like character set, viewport settings, and the title of the page.
I link an external stylesheet (styles.css) to apply styles to my calculator.
The body of the HTML contains the calculator structure. It consists of an input field to display the input and results, and a set of buttons for numbers and arithmetic operations.

CSS Styling (styles.css):
I define styles for the body, setting the font family and background color.
Styles for the calculator container (div.calculator) are defined to set its width, margin, padding, border, border-radius, background color, and box-shadow.
The display input field (#display) is styled with width, margin, padding, border, border-radius, and font-size.
The button container (div.buttons) is styled as a grid layout with columns of equal width.
Button styles include padding, border, border-radius, background color, and cursor pointer. Additionally, I define a hover effect for buttons.

JavaScript Functionality (script.js):
Three JavaScript functions are defined:
addToDisplay(value): This function is called when a number or operator button is clicked. It appends the clicked value to the display field.
clearDisplay(): This function clears the display field when the "C" button is clicked.
calculate(): This function evaluates the expression in the display field when the "=" button is clicked and displays the result.

Integration:
The HTML file links the CSS file for styling and the JavaScript file for functionality.
The JavaScript functions are invoked by onclick event handlers attached to the buttons in the HTML.

Execution:
When the user interacts with the calculator by clicking buttons, the corresponding JavaScript functions are executed, updating the display field and performing calculations.
Overall, this code creates a basic calculator interface with HTML, styles it using CSS, and adds interactivity and functionality using JavaScript.
